Revision history for ApacheDBI.

0.81  Sep 08, 1998
	- Cache entries consider the AuthName to distinguish 
	  between identical user-ids in different authorization 
	  realms. 

0.80  Jul 26, 1998
	- applied patch from Anto Prijosoesilo <anto@inet.co.th>:
	  change second argument for crypt function from $salt
	  to $passwd in order to be compatible with BSD.
	- applied patch for Apache::DBI.pm from Randy Harmon 
	  <rjharmon@uptimecomputers.com>: reject database connect 
	  during server startup.
	- call CleanupHandler in Authen DBI and AuthzDBI only if 
	  cache_time is configured.

0.79  Jun 06, 1998
	- implemented a simple caching mechanism in AuthenDBI as 
	  well as in AuthzDBI. Per default this cache is disabled 
	  and can be enabled by setting Auth_DBI_cache_time > 0. 
	  YOU NEED AT LEAST VERSION apache_1.3b6 !
	- applied patch from Jeff Baker <jeff@godzilla.tamu.edu>
	  fix menu item for DBI connections that are made using 
	  the Oracle TNS listener.
	- implemented proposal from Leslie Mikesell <les@Mcs.Net>
	  change group-handling in AuthzDBI. All groups related to
	  the given user are selected at once and then put into a 
	  comma-separated list. This list is compared with the 
	  required groups. 
	  Depending upon the existence of Auth_DBI_grp_table, the 
	  SQL-select looks either in the pwd_table or in the 
	  grp_table for the groupid. PLEASE CHECK THE MODULE 
	  DOCUMENTATION AND YOUR .htaccess !

0.78  February 18, 1998
        - applied patch from "B. W. Fitzpatrick" <fitz@onShore.com>
          DBI calls connect always with 4 parameters, even if they
          are empty. This results in an error with DBD-Informix.
        - added '$dbh->disconnect' before 'return SERVER_ERROR;'
          (fyodor@mp.aha.ru <Fyodor Krasnov>).
	- added optional where-clause in AuthenDBI as well as
          in AuthzDBI (Helmut Patay <Helmut.Patay@mch.sni.de>).

0.77 January 18, 1998
        - applied patches from Doug MacEachern:
          o new method  Apache::DBI->connect_on_init()
          o set environment variable REMOTE_GROUP in AuthzDBI.pm.

        - new module: AuthzDBI for Authorization,

        - complete rewrite of AuthenDBI.
        - configuration directives and functionality 
          of both modules are supposed to be identical
          with mod_auth_msql of the apache daemon.

          consistent with other authentication modules.
