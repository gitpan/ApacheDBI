DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 0.73 of Apache::AuthenDBI.pm and Apache::DBI.pm.

These two modules are supposed to be used with the Apache daemon together with an 
embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. AuthenDBI.pm provides authentication via 
Perl's DBI and DBI.pm provides a persistent database connection. 

With the first database access the connection to the database is established. It 
remains open for the lifetime of the httpd and supersedes the time consuming connect 
and disconnect with standard CGI for every database access. For further information 
and limitations read the module documentation.

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:
---------------------

Please send comments and bug-reports to <E.Mergl@bawue.de>

Before sending a bug report it might be useful to look at 
the debug output. For this set the following variables in 
your script:

  $Apache::DBI::DEBUG = 1
  $Apache::AuthenDBI::DEBUG 1

and watch the error logfile.

If this doesn't help, please mail me the debug output and 
include the output of perl -v,
    and the output of perl -V,
    and the version of DBI,
    and the used database
in your bug-report.
