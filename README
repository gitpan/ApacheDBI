DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 0.1 of Apache::DBI.pm.

This module provides a persistent database connection via DBI. 
It is supposed to be used with the Apache daemon together with 
an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. With the first database 
access the connection to the database is established. It remains 
open for the lifetime of the httpd, if not an explicit destroy of 
the database handle drops the connection. This way, the time 
consuming connect and disconnect with standard CGI for every 
database access becomes superfluous. 



USAGE:
------

In your perl scripts you have to replace the command 

          use DBI;
with
          use Apache::DBI;

Also replace every 

         DBI->connect()
with
         Apache::DBI->connect()

The connect() function returns the last database handle. If the 
database handle is not valid, a new connection is established. 



INSTALLATION:
-------------

1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
4.   make install
